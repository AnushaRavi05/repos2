1.Find the difference between the total number of CITY entries in the table and the number of distinct CITY entries in the table.
The table name is STATION 
SELECT 
(COUNT(CITY)-COUNT(DISTINCT CITY)) AS difference
FROM STATION;
2.Query the two cities in STATION with the shortest and longest CITY names, as well as their respective lengths (i.e.: number of characters in the name). If there is more than one smallest or largest city, choose the one that comes first when ordered alphabetically.
The STATION table is described as follows:
(SELECT CITY,LENGTH(CITY) AS name_length
FROM STATION
ORDER BY LENGTH(CITY) ASC,CITY ASC
FETCH FIRST 1 ROW ONLY)
UNION ALL
(SELCT CITY,LENGTH(CITY) AS name_length
FROM STATION 
ORDER BY LENGTH(CITY) DESC,CITY ASC
FETCH FIRST 1 ROW ONLY;)
3.Query the list of CITY names from STATION which have vowels (i.e., a, e, i, o, and u) as both their first
and last characters. Your result cannot contain duplicates.
SELECT DISTINCT CITY
FROM STATION
WHERE (CITY LIKE 'A%' OR CITY LIKE 'E%' OR CITY LIKE 'I%' OR CITY LIKE 'O%' OR CITY LIKE 'U%'
       OR CITY LIKE 'a%' OR CITY LIKE 'e%' OR CITY LIKE 'i%' OR CITY LIKE 'o%' OR CITY LIKE 'u%')
  AND (CITY LIKE '%A' OR CITY LIKE '%E' OR CITY LIKE '%I' OR CITY LIKE '%O' OR CITY LIKE '%U'
       OR CITY LIKE '%a' OR CITY LIKE '%e' OR CITY LIKE '%i' OR CITY LIKE '%o' OR CITY LIKE '%u');
